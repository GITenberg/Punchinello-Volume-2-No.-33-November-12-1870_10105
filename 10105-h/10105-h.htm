      <p><b>GREAT MEN OF AMERICA.</b></p>
      <p>By MOSE SKINNER</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">DANIEL WEBSTER</p>
      <p>Was the sort of a man you don't find laying round loose
nowadays to any great extent. It's a pity his brains wasn't preserved
in a glass case, where the imbecile lunatics at Washington could take a
whiff occasionally. It would do 'em good.</p>
      <p>We are told that as a boy DANIEL was stupid, but this has been
said of so many great men that it's getting stale. Some talented men
were undoubtedly stupid boys, but it doesn't follow that every idiotic
youth will make an eminent statesman. But there are plenty of vacancies
in the statesman business. A great many men go into it, but they fail
for want of capital. If they would only stick to their legitimate
business of clam-digging, or something of that sort, we should
appreciate them, and their obituary notice would be a thing to love,
because 'twould be short.</p>
      <p>But D. WEBSTER wasn't one of this sort. He didn't force
Nature. He forgot enough every day to set five modern politicians up
for life. When he opened his mouth to speak, it didn't act upon the
audience like chloroform, nor did the senate-chamber look five minutes
after like a receiving tomb, with the bodies laying round
promiscuously. I should say not. He could wade right into the middle of
a dictionary and drag out some ideas that were wholesome. Yes, when
DANIEL in that senatorial den <i>did</i> get his back up, the
political lions just stood back and growled.</p>
      <p>Take him altogether he was our biggest gun, and it's a pity he
went off as he did, for he was the Great Expounder of the Constitution.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: center;">HON. JOHN MORRISSEY</p>
      <p>Is also a Great Ex-pounder. Even greater than WEBSTER, for the
constitution of the United States is a trifling affair, compared with
the constitution of J.C. HEENAN.</p>
      <p>Mr. MORRISSEY is a very able man and made his mark early in
life. Before he could write his name, I'm told. No man has made more
brilliant hits, and his speeches are concise and full of originality.
"I'll take mine straight." "No sugar for me," &amp;c., have become as
household words.</p>
      <p>A man like this, though he may be vilified and slandered for
awhile, will eventually come in on the home stretch with a right bower
to spare.</p>
      <p>That's a nice place JOHN has got at Saratoga. Fitted up so
elegantly, and with so much money in it, it looks like a Fairy bank
with the fairies gambolling upon the green. It's all very pretty, no
doubt, but excuse me if I pass.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: center;">GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN.</p>
      <p>This gentleman is yet destined to send a thrill of joy to our
hearts, and flood our souls with a calm and tranquil joy. This will
come off when his funeral takes place. He wasn't born like other
people. He was made to order for the position of common scold in a
country sewing-circle.</p>
      <p>But he wasn't satisfied. He wanted to be an Eminent Lunatic
and found private mad-houses. And so he began to lecture. He used to
rehearse in a graveyard, and it was a common thing for a newly-buried
corpse to organize a private resurrection and make for the woods,
howling dismally.</p>
      <p>A village out West was singularly unfortunate last summer. In
the first place the cholera raged, then they had an earthquake, and
then G.F. TRAIN lectured three nights. Owing to this accumulation of
horrors the village is no longer to be found on the maps. TRAIN'S
second night did the business for 'em. The once happy villagers are now
aimless wanderers, and one poor old man was found in the churchyard,
studying a war map of Paris and vicinity in a late New York paper.</p>
      <p>It is said that TRAIN has his eye on the White House, and is
indeed a shrewd, far-seeing man. When he visited Europe and kissed all
the little Irish girls, could he have had in his mind the time when
they, as naturalized American Female Suffragers, would cast their votes
for G.F. TRAIN as President?</p>
      <p>That the mind of the reader may not become hopelessly dazed by
contemplating this last paragraph, I will stop.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: center;">MOTHER GOOSE.</p>
      <p>I cannot close these memoirs without a simple tribute to this
remarkable woman, who has probably done more to mould the destinies of
this Republic than any other man put together. She was an eminently
pious woman, devoted body and soul to Foreign Missions, and to the
great work of sending the gospel to New Jersey.</p>
      <p>But it was as a composer that her brilliant talents stand
preeminent. MOZART, BEETHOVEN, and a host of others excelled in this
respect, but they all lack that exquisite pathos and graceful rhetoric
which so distinguished this queen of literature. The beautiful
creations of that fruitful brain are as a passing panorama of constant
delight. Her style is singularly free from affectation, and, while we
are at one moment rapt in wonder at her chaste and vigorous description
of the annoyances of a female in the autumn of life, training up a
large family in the limited accommodations afforded by a common shoe,
we cannot but feel a twinge of compassion for the singular Mrs. HUBBARD
and her lovely dog, who "had none," only to have those tears chased
away by the arch and guileless portrayal of the eccentric JOHN HORNER.</p>
      <p>That we cannot to-day gaze upon the classic lineaments of her
who welded such a facile pen, is a source of the most poignant regret.
It is a crying shame, for I think I am correct when I say that there
does not exist on the civilized globe a statue of this peerless woman,
but she will always live as long as there are infant minds to form, or
tender recollections of childhood to remember.</p>
      <p>P.S.&#8212;I forgot to say that I hold a copyright of old GRANNY
GOOSE'S works. I have just got it renewed, and it is as vigorous as a
kicking-mule. Send in your orders. Contributions to the old gal's
statue will be duly acknowledged, and deposited with my tailor.</p>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 45%;"> <br>
      <p><b>THE PLAYS AND SHOWS.</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/102.jpg" align="left" alt="">JANAUSCHEK is a
Bohemian, and with the Bohemian propensity for
picking up things, has picked up the English language. The public is
somewhat divided in its estimate of her skill in speaking English.
One-half of her average audience insists that she speaks better English
than nine-tenths of our native actresses: the other half asserts that
she is at times nearly unintelligible. Neither of these statements
necessarily contradicting the other, they might both be easily true.
The fact is, however, that she speaks English like a foreigner. Mud
itself&#8212;or a Sun editorial&#8212;could not be plainer than this definition of
her exact proficiency in our unmelodious tongue.</p>
      <p>If we go to see her play "Lady Macbeth," we meet evidences at
every step of her want of familiarity with English, or at all events
with American customs. We find her playing at the ACADEMY, and we at
once remark that no one but an unnecessarily foreign actress would dare
to awaken the sepulchral echoes of that dismal tomb. We find, too, that
at the very threshold of the house she defies the one of the most
time-honored institutions of our stage, by employing a pleasant and
courteous door-keeper&#8212;instead of the snarling Cerberus who lies in wait
at the doors of other theatres. We find again that she outrages the
public by the presence of decent and civil ushers, who neither insult
the male spectators by their surly impudence, nor annoy the lady
visitor by coloring her train with tobacco juice. So that before the
curtain rises we are prepared to lament over her unfamiliarity with
American customs, and to predict her ignorance of the American, as well
as the English language.</p>
      <p>Divers well-meaning persons repeat the dialogue of the earlier
scenes of the play. There is a good deal of dramatic force in the legs
of Mr. MONTGOMERY, who plays "Macbeth," much animation in the feathers
which Mr. STUDLEY'S "Macduff" wears in his hat, and a foreshadowing of
ghostly peculiarities in the solemn stride of Mr. DE VERE'S "Banquo."
We listen to these gentlemen with polite patience, waiting for the
appearance of "Lady Macbeth." When at length that strong-minded female
strides across the stage, we hail her with rapturous applause, and
listen for the strident voice with which the average "Lady Macbeth"
reads her husband's letter.</p>
      <p>We don't hear it, however, for JANAUSCHEK reads in a tone as
low as that which a sensible woman who was plotting treason and murder
would be apt to use. Why "Lady Macbeth" should proclaim her deadly
purpose at the top of her lungs is quite incomprehensible, except upon
the theory that stage traditions have confounded the Scotch with the
Irish, and that the "Macbeths" husband and wife&#8212;being the typical
Fenians of the period, were accustomed to roar their secrets to the
listening world.</p>
      <p>Be that as it may, we are constrained to note the actress's
unfamiliarity with the language, as evinced in the tone in which she
reads the letter, and also in the way in which she urges her husband
onward in the path of crime. The usual "Lady Macbeth" "goes for" her
weakminded spouse, and drives him by threats and strong-language to
consent to her little game. JANAUSCHEK, on the contrary, does not raise
a broom-stick, or even her voice, at "Macbeth," but actually coaxes him
to be so good as to kill the king, so that she can bring all her
relations to court, and appoint them surveyors, and internal revenue
collectors, and foreign ministers. This is not the tone of other
actresses in the same part, and we therefore at once charge her
departure from the common standard to her ignorance of English.</p>
      <p>We listen with fortitude to the dismal singing of the witches
and their friends in mask and domino. The music, we are told, is
"LOCKE'S music." What is the proper key for LOCKE'S music, is a
question which we have never attempted to solve, but we heartily wish
that the key were lost forever, since by its aid the singers open
vistas of musical dreariness which are disheartening to the last
degree. But we sustain our spirits with the thought of the bloody
murder that is coming. Talk as we ill, we all enjoy our murders,
whether we read of them in the <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Police Gazette</i>,
or witness them upon the stage.</p>
      <p>When JANAUSCHEK comes upon "Macbeth" with his bloody hands,
and explains to him that it is now too late to repent, either of murder
or matrimony, she furnishes us with more instances of her unfamiliarity
with the language. Her night-dress is not at all the sort of thing
which an English-speaking woman would be willing to sleep in. We are
confident upon this point, and we have on our side the testimony of a
married man who has lived four years in Chicago, and has been annually
married with great regularity. If he doesn't know what the average
female regards as the proper thing in night-dresses, it would be
difficult to find a man who does. Then, too, her gross ignorance of
English is shown in her back hair, which is a foot longer than the
average hair of previous "Lady Macbeths," and is as thick and massive
as a lion's mane. Wicked and punnish persons go so far as to call it
her mane attraction. They are wrong, however. JANAUSCHEK does not draw
by the force of capillary attraction. By the bye, did any one ever
notice the fact that while a painter cannot be considered an artist
unless he draws well, an actress may be the greatest of artists and not
be able to draw a hundred people? But this is wandering.</p>
      <p>Owing to the imperfections of her English, JANAUSCHEK does not
indulge in drinking from the gilded pasteboard goblets which grace the
banquet scene. She also shows her lingual weakness in the sleep-walking
scene. For instance, when, after having reigned queen of Scotland for
several months, the happy thought of washing her hands strikes her, she
commits the absurdity of scrubbing them with her hair. On the other
hand, she pronounces the words "damned spot" with a, perfection of
accent that constrains us to believe that she must have taken at least
a few lessons in pronunciation from some of the leading members of
WALLACK'S company. Still, her way of walking blindly into the table,
and falling over casual chairs, ought to convince the most skeptical
person that her English accent is not yet what it should be. And in
general, her walk and conversation in this scene demonstrate that even
the most carefully simulated somnambulism may not resemble in all
respects the most approved Oxford pronunciation.</p>
      <p>But when we are freed from the depressing influences of the
Academical Crypt, we forget all but our admiration of JANAUSCHEK'S
superb acting, and the exceptional command which she has gained over a
language so vexatious in its villanous consonants as our own. And we
express to every available listener the earnest hope that SKEBACH and
FECHTER will profit by her success, and at once begin the study of
English, with the view of devoting their efforts hereafter to the
American stage.</p>

      <p>A Rampant Virginia editor proposes to kill off the Yankees by
putting poison in chewing-tobacco, so that we shall meet mortality in
mastication, fate in fine-cut, and perdition in the soothing plug! In
short, Virginia not having got the best of it in political quiddities,
this pen-patriot is for trying the other kind. The short-sightedness of
this policy will be evident, when we remember how many Republicans
consider the weed to be the abomination of desolation. Virginia might
poison chewing-tobacco till the crack of doom, but what effect would
that have upon the eschewing (not chewing) GREELEY, who, even if he
used it, has bitten T(he) WEED so many times that he can consider
himself poison-proof. When, moreover, this LUCRETIA BORGIA in

dropped, by dramific degrees, in a state of absolute tipsidity, and
four clergymen, who happened to be passing, carried him home on a
shutter, and thus ushered him in all his drunkosity, into the presence
of his little better-half, who was drawing in crayons in the back

you come home in that odd manner, upon a shutter?" "Because, <i>mon

on the country, devastations of crops, bombarding of cities, and the

with such ideas are simply unbearable.</p>

      <p>"Up in a balloon, boys!"&#8212;<i>Macbeth</i>.</p>
      <p>TOURS, FIFTH WEEK Of THE REPUBLIC, 1870.</p>
      <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: To all men of lofty ambition I would
recommend a balloon excursion. The higher you get, the smaller and more
insignificant do earthly things appear. A balloon is the best pulpit
imaginable from which to preach a sermon upon the littleness of mundane
realities, first&#8212;because no one can hear you, and your congregation
cannot therefore be held responsible for indifference to your teaching;
and second&#8212;because at that height you are fully impressed with the
truth of what you say.</p>
      <p>Aspirations of whatever kind, all longings and emotions of the
"Excelsior" order, all appeals to "look aloft," come handier when you
can "do" them in an aerial car.</p>
      <p>You will pardon this philosophic digression in respect to the
peculiar feelings of a man who has just been "up in a balloon." Our
air-ship had been anchored in the <i>Champ de Mars</i> two days,
waiting for a fair wind. An hour before we started, a Yorkshireman, who
had evidently never seen such a creation before, annoyed me with
incessant questions as to what it was. His large, wondering, stupid
eyes never ceased gazing at the monster as it tugged heavily at the
stake which held it. "Na' wha' maun <i>that</i> be?" he exclaimed,
starting back as it gave a very violent jerk. I could stand it no
longer, and thus broke forth:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"See here, my good fellow, you've got plenty of cheek to be
bothering me with your confounded ridiculous questions; and so I'll
answer you once for all. What you see tied fast there is called a
balloon, and it's only a French method of drawing Englishmen's teeth."
He left me&#8212;I trust not in anger; but that was the last I saw of the
Yorkshireman.</p>
      <p>We got off, (M. GODARD and I) about four o'clock P.M., and
ascended steadily till Paris, with its rim of fortifications, looked
more like the crater of a volcano than anything else. I brought out my
opera-glass as we moved in the direction of Versailles, and
reconnoitred the situation. In a field adjoining the palace I saw an
object that looked like a post driven into the ground, and capped with
a large-sized clam-shell. GODARD levelled his glass and examined it.
His lip curled proudly with scorn as he said:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"That is the butcher himself, WILLIAM of Prussia. The
clam-like appearance you notice is due to the baldness of his head."</p>
      <p>I only said: "Can it be possible?" and we moved on. How my
blood throbbed as we cavorted through the blue depths of heaven! I was
far from feeling blue myself, and GODARD said that if anything I was
green. The bearings of the remark did not strike me at the time, as a
cannon-ball from the direction of Versailles whirled within twenty feet
of the balloon and lifted the right flank (a military expression) of my
moustache into your subscriber's eye, notwithstanding it was waxed with
LOUVET'S best, warranted to keep each hair <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>,
even in the worst gales. From that moment I renounced LOUVET. Following
the cannon-shot came a miscellaneous assortment of small projectiles,
which had the effect of creating some excitement among the atmospheric <i>animalculae</i>,
but failed to disturb the serenity of M. GODARD or myself. When about
ten miles from Blois I detected what I supposed was a large vein of
chalk-pits. It was very white, and apparently motionless. My companion
expressed his surprise at the difficulty I had in distinguishing
objects correctly, and seemed to lose patience.</p>
      <p>"<i>Bigarre</i>, you no know zat? It ees ze dirty Proosien
linen vashed out, and hoong zere to dry!"</p>
      <p>I told him in Arabic that he needn't get his back up; but he
understood me not, and continued playing with the cats which we were
transporting to Tours to protect the Commissary stores from the ravages
of the rats that the Prussians had despatched to eat up the provisions
of the garrison. Towards night I began to have a queer sensation in the
stomach. It wasn't like sea-sickness, nor like the feeling produced by
swinging. If a man just recovering from the effects of his first cigar
were offered a bowl of hot goose-grease for supper, I suppose he would
have felt as I felt. At the moment a queer twinge took me; I
ejaculated: "Oh! Lord!"</p>
      <p>"Vat ees de matter?" inquired GODARD. If the man had had any
other nationality, I might have talked sense to him; but he was a
Frenchman, so I said:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"Do you love me?"</p>
      <p>"Do I loves you?"</p>
      <p>"Yes!" I roared frantically, "do you love me?"</p>
      <p>"<i>Begaire</i> I dunno, but I zinks so."</p>
      <p>"Then," said I, dimly discerning a chance of relief from my
suffering, "throw me out as ballast."</p>
      <p>"Oh, <i>horrible! horrible! Mon Dieu!</i> vat a man!"</p>
      <p>I turned my sickly gaze upon him and saw that he was deadly
pale, and that the perspiration stood out in great drops upon his
forehead. The explanation was plain enough&#8212;he took me for a maniac. I
would have protested and moved the previous question, but taking a
small phial from his pocket he broke off the head and threw the
contents in my face. Ten seconds later I was totally oblivious, and
upon recovering found myself in this place, where such strange things
are going on that my fingers prick to write them.</p>

had upon Exhibition His Marine Majesty the Whale. The captive was shown
for the ridiculously small sum of two shillings, and great was the
gathering to gaze upon the spouter, who would have come just in time to
attend the political caucuses, only he happens to be dead, and cannot
spout any more, albeit his jaw is still tremendous. His defunct
condition renders it unnecessary to feed him upon JONAHS, which is
lucky for a good many superfluous voyagers upon the Ship of State. If
the King of All the Fishes can draw such crowds at a quarter a head,
what a chance is there for our friend LOUIS NAPOLEON! If he will but

      <p><b>THE MICROSCOPIC MAN.</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/105.jpg" align="left" alt="B">umps have a
great deal to answer for. Of course we refer to
phrenological bumps, from which, possibly, the powerful adjective
"bumptious" is derived, it being applicable to a person whose
conflicting bumps keep him continually on the rampage.</p>
      <p>Of all such persons, the one with microscopes in his bumps for
eyes is the most bumptious. He is continually detecting pernicious
particles in everything that he eats and drinks. One such will seize a
pepper-castor, invert it over his mashed turnips, spank it as if it
were a child, and then, peering at the dark particles with which the
succulent heap of vegetable matter is dusted, proceed to deliver a
lecture upon the poisons that we swallow with our daily food. He sees
iron-filings in the pepper. Also particles of the tail-feathers of
Spanish flies. He will tell you that if you continue to use pepper like
that for a long duration&#8212;say seventy or eighty years&#8212;you will have iron
enough in your stomach, from the filings, to make a ten-pound
dumb-bell, and blistering stuff sufficient from the Spanish fly to draw
all the interest of the National Debt. If the pepper happens to belong
to the Cayenne persuasion, he magnifies it into a hod of bricks. It is
his hod way of accounting for it. Keep using it daily for
half-a-century, says he, and see if you don't wake up some fine morning
and find yourself a brick chimney stuck up on the roof of a house for
bats to live in. It will be a just judgment on you; and small will be
to you the consolation should some poetical friend pen an
epigrammatical threnody to your memory, telling in "In Memoriam"
stanzas how you "went up like a thousand of bricks."</p>
      <p>"Beef?" says the microscopic man, probing the meat with a
pencil of light that beams from his right eye (the other being closed
for concentration purposes), "Beef, sir?&#8212;not a bit of the <i>bos taurus</i>
about it, sir. Horse, donkey, mule, zebra&#8212;what you will, but not a
single fibre of ox. Did you ever see the fibres of beef run in a
direction due north and south, like these? If you did I should like to
know it, sir. I inspected this meat raw, sir, to-day, on the butcher's
stall, and the minute <i>ova</i> perceptible in it were those of the
horse gad-fly, not the ox gad-fly, sir. Yes, begad, sir, and I'm
prepared to maintain the fact upon oath, sir."</p>
      <p>Porter and other malt liquors are favorite subjects for the
analysis of the microscopic man. As you are placidly enjoying your pint
of GUINNESS'S brown stout, he will look at you for minutes with a
compassionate smile. Then, suddenly plunging into his favorite horror
knee-deep, he will ask you if you know what becomes of all the ends of
smoked-out cigars. Of course you submit that little boys pick them up
and smoke them to everlasting annihilation. "Pshaw! sir," exclaims the
microscopic person; "there is a man in the City of Dublin, sir&#8212;I
believe he is a baronet now, but will not force that as a fact&#8212;and he
made an enormous fortune by going about the streets at early dawn and
picking up all the cigar-stumps he could find, and they were not few,
as you may suppose, in that smokingest of cities. He used to furnish
these by the ton to old GUINNESS, who used them for giving color and
body to his famous 'Stout.' Body?&#8212;I should think so rather!&#8212;but only
think where the body came from! Just recall to mind the filthiest
gutter that ever you saw in your life, with the numerous ends of cigars
that you perfectly remember having observed sweltering in it, and then
take another pull at your GUINNESS, sir, and I wish you joy of it, sir!"</p>
      <p>Once we remember to have heard the subject of the possibility
of lizards snakes, frogs, and other cheerful reptiles having resided
for indefinite periods in the stomachs of human subjects, discussed in
the presence of the microscopic man. A lady of the party was skeptical
on the subject, dwelling especially upon the impossibility of any
person swallowing a reptile unawares. "Observe those water-cresses of
which you have been partaking so freely, madam," said the microscopic
man. "Beneath each leaf I discern <i>ova</i> of things that it might
horrify you to enumerate in full. Suffice it to say, then, for the
present, that on the leaves of this small sprig culled by me at random

contortrix</i>, than which, when fully developed, no more deadly
reptile wriggles upon earth. See this minute agglomeration of yellowish
specks on the stalk of the cress. These are the eggs of the <i>lacerta
horrida</i>, a lizard that within the large warts with which its
epidermis is studded secretes a poison of the most virulent character.
Others, too, I discern, but they are too disagreeable to dwell upon&#8212;not
to speak of one having <i>them</i> dwell inside one, instead&#8212;ha! ha!
Now, remember that all these germs are hatched by gentle warmth. No

      <p>In this day of monetary papyrus, it is pleasing to read of an
ancient matron in Lafayette, Ind., who, at the age of eighty-nine, has
gone to her reward, leaving no property save a $20 gold piece. For
several years, she has been reserving this honest coin to pay her
funeral expenses; and one cannot help surmising that she must have been
distantly related to the late Old Bullion BENTON. "No National Bank
nonsense at my tomb!" said she; "no grimed and greasy currency for my
undertaker! I will have a specie-paying funeral or none at all." As we
have the precedent of a great many Old Ladies in the Cabinet, we are
rather sorry that it is too late to invite this clear-headed dame to

      <br>
Bread and Butter vs. Old Cheese.<br>
      <br>
I hadent got but a little ways into the Navy-Yard, when a soljer steps
up before me, and pintin his bagonet at my throack, said:<br>
      <br>
"Pass."<br>
      <br>
I stepped tother side of him to obey his orders, when he agin pinted
his gun at me and said:<br>
      <br>
"Pass."<br>
      <br>
Thinkin I was on the rong side of him, I undertook to pass into the
middle of the road, when he vociferated in louder tones:<br>
      <br>
"Pass!"<br>
      <br>
"Well," says I, by this time considerably riled at sich skanderlous
treatment at the <i>hands</i> of this goverment, "if you'l stop rammin
your bagonet into my hash digester and let me <i>pass</i>, ile be hily
tickled."<br>
      <br>
I was madder than if I had been a candidate for offis, and dident get
elected.<br>
      <br>
"See here, Mister hard-tack Cowpenner," said I, addressin him, "how
dare you stop <i>me</i> in this ere outragous manner? You say 'pass,'
and when I try to pass, you jab at my innards with that mustick in a
rather oncomfortable manner. What do you mean?"<br>
      <br>
"I mean, sir," said he, sholderin his shootin iron, "that if you want
to go further, you must get a pass from the offis across the way."<br>
      <br>
"Oho! that's a gooseberry pie of a different flavor," said I, coolin
off; "why dident you say so before?" and I pinted for the offis to get
the pass.<br>
      <br>
After bein put through a course of red tape, such as feelin of my
pultz, lookin down my throte, and soundin me on my Spread Eagleism, I
got the pass.<br>
      <br>
While on my tower of observashuns, a mechanikle lookin individual
approched me, and says:<br>
      <br>
"Good mornin, Congressman WEBSTER."<br>
      <br>
I turned in cirprise, as several other men dropped their tools and
rushed out and surrounded me.<br>
      <br>
"God bless you, Mister WEBSTER!" said one.<br>
      <br>
"Make way for the noble and good WEBSTER," said another.<br>
      <br>
"Let me kiss the hand of the great statesman," says a third, fallin to
and gettin my thumb in his mouth.<br>
      <br>
"Mister WEBSTER, take care of me, I am yours to command," says a 4th,
who jumped wildly for an old tobacker cud I had just throde away.<br>
      <br>
On all sides, men was fallin down to worship me, just as if I was the
Golden Calf, spoken of in scripters, or else some great poletikle
Mogul, with a pocket full of blank commissions, ready to be filled out
for good fat offises.<br>
      <br>
All of a sudden, it popped into my mind that these 8 hour sons of toil
hadent heard that DANIEL WEBSTER was dead, or else dident see the joak,
when DAN said: "I aint dead," and supposed from my likeness to him that
I was D. WEBSTER.<br>
      <br>
I couldent blame 'em for makin such a mistake, when I reccolected the
time I was introjuced to the great man. It was when I was Gustise of
the Peace.<br>
      <br>
As our hands clasped each other, we was both revitted to the spot, and
the rivets was clinched tite.<br>
      <br>
"What! it can't be possible!" said Mr. WEBSTER, the first to break the
silence. "Well if you haint another WEBSTER, you'l pass for D.
WEBSTER'S bust, any day."<br>
      <br>
"And," said I, wishin to return the compliment, "if you haint <i>Green</i>,
you can pass any time for GREEN on a bust."<br>
      <br>
This was one of my witcisms, and it made DANIEL blurt with lafter.<br>
      <br>
But, Mister PUNCHINELLO, me and WEBSTER looked so much alike, that if
his tailor had sent him a soot of clothes at that time, I believe, in
the confusion, that just as like as not, I should have thought I was
WEBSTER, and wore off the clothes.<br>
      <br>
But, to "retrace my tale," as the canine said, when a flee was suckin
the heart's blood from his cordil appendige&#8212;<br>
      <br>
"Well, my friends," said I, humerin these men in their mistake, "what
can I do for you down to Washington?"<br>
      <br>
"Do for us? thou great and mitey!" said they all to once, "keep us into
offis&#8212;we 'go' <i>you</i>, Nov. 8th."<br>
      <br>
"Well," said I, "my good men, my word is law down to Washington.
Everybody respects the great DANIL WEBSTER."<br>
      <br>
"Eh!&#8212;who&#8212;what," exclaimed several.<br>
      <br>
"I say that I, DANIL WEBSTER, is great guns with the goverment," was my
reply.<br>
      <br>
"DANIEL WEBSTER be d&#8212;d," said the ring-leader. "No, Sir! ED WEBSTER,
the nominee for Congress, and Wet Nurse <i>pro tem.</i> over Unkle
Sam's family in this 'ere <i>nursery</i>, is the man we're after.
Haint you that man?"<br>
      <br>
"You don't mean the chap who was U.S. Assessor, agin whom I heard them
Wall street brokers and scalpers cussin and swearin like a lot of Rocky
Mountin savages chock full of fluid pirotecknicks, because he made them
pay a goverment tax?"<br>
      <br>
"The same! the same!" they all hollered.<br>
      <br>
"Well! sweet wooers of the bread and butter brigade," said I, "speakin
after the manner of men, you've got ontop the rong hencoop this time.

      <p><b>SIMILE USED UP.</b></p>
      <p>We regret to state, that in consequence of a late discovery by
one B&Eacute;CHAMP, of living things in chalk (he has actually seen 'em
wriggle!) we are no longer at liberty to say, "As different as Chalk
and Cheese." The difference is gone! If it is not, we would ask, where
is it?</p>
      <p>It is true, chalk is not in so general use, as an article of
diet, as cheese, except in boarding-schools; but the difference is
plainly one of degree rather than of kind. We have heard of "prepared
chalk." It has been whispered that gentle spinsters use it for a
beautifyer. We rather incline to the belief that it is prepared for the
inside rather than the outside of humanity.</p>
      <p>At any rate, the two articles now agree in their most
prominent characteristics&#8212;which they did not, till M. B&Eacute;CHAMP
looked into the matter with his microscope.</p>
      <p>'Tis thus, alas! our cherished similes are going. One by one
are they B&eacute;-champ-ed (or chawed up) by the voracious creatures
who hunger and thirst after novelty. Why, we expect to be told, ere
long,&#8212;and have it proved to us,&#8212;that the Moon after all is actually and
truly made of Green Cheese. And there will go another fond comparison!
Nay, more;&#8212;perhaps Cheese itself is but Chalk, in its incipient stages
of development,&#8212;with the tenantry already secured, however, that make
it so lively inside.&#8212;<i>Si sic Omnes</i>.</p>

      <p>Some people have a very curious way of doing things. Nowadays
when the world has advanced by prodigious strides almost to the limit
of civilization, and having no further to go, is debating within itself
whether it shall lie down and take a rest, a man don't go to so much
trouble to have his eyes out. The age is a fast one, you know; so, when
the man feels like having his glims doused, he just jumps into the
midst of a crowd of real b'hoys, runs his head, good-naturedly, you
know, against a pair of knuckles, and the business is settled with
"neatness and despatch," as the job-printers say.</p>
      <p>How different our poet's description. He must have been a man
of wonderful experience; and foresight, let us add, since from his
simple yet wonderfully powerful sketches there is gained an insight
into all the mysterious workings of humanity, from the lulling of the
babe in the cradle, the ruthless disruption of the apron-string that he
is led with, because some naughty little boys laughed at him, to the
tolling of the bell by the old sexton over another dead.</p>
      <p>Well, there is no use in moralizing. The tale is before us,
graphically drawn; and to the reader is left naught but the pleasure of
contemplating its beauties. In his pithy way the poet describes a man
who, though possessed of some good qualities, evidently did not know
how to use them. Though the poet has never yet touched upon politics,
yet the careful reader will find that the hero of the sketch must have
been a young Democrat, since he is made to appear very nimble, and has
a fondness, partial to himself, of getting into rather thorny places.
What led him into those dangerous places we have very little chance of
knowing. "He was wondrous wise," saith the poet, and forsooth he jumps
into a bramble-bush, the last place in the world where a <i>wise</i>
man is to be found. But then, perhaps, a tincture of irony flew from
our poet's pen; the hero was wise in his own esteem, perhaps; or was
wise in the opinion of his friends, whose wisdom seemed to be
consummated in doing something ridiculous.</p>
      <p>It is very fortunate for the social welfare of community that
all its actions should not be sublime. Mankind would become too serious
and morose and cynical, and life would be a burden. The ridiculous
makes it enjoyable, but at the expense of those who cause the ridicule.
Man <i>must</i> laugh, no matter what the cost to the object laughed
at.</p>
      <p>Ordinary intelligence would have decided the fate of the wise
individual who found no other use for his eyes but to scratch them out
in a bramble-bush. But our poet dealeth otherwise with his portraits.
He shows us the fate of an overwrought, badly instilled wisdom; yet
when that wisdom has been deserted by its cause, the promptings of a
heart, pure at the core, hold up to contempt the mad teachings of the
sophist.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When
he saw what he had done,"</span> </div>
      <p>continues the poet, in a sense not entirely literal, for
reasons which are not necessary to be explained, this man of wondrous
wisdom saw that he had been made a dupe. Cunning as a fox were his
would-be friends; but having got him to the bush, there they let him
gambol as he would, ensnaring him to his own almost utter ruin.</p>
      <p>A new light flashes upon his brain; his folly appears plainly
to his mind; he had ruthlessly deserted his fond parents; sought evil
counsel; was deserted by his false friends; and was now in a deplorable
condition indeed. Remorse sometimes brings repentance; at least it did
in this case. Our hero remembered the good teachings of his early
youth; and, like the prodigal son, was willing to return to the home of
his fathers. True, he was in a bramble-bush; but, <i>similia similibus
curantur</i> (which, interpreted, signifies, "You tickle me and I'll
tickle you").</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He
jumped into another bush,"</span> </div>
      <p>found his eyes as they were before his sad catastrophe, and
without ceremony returned them to their places, by another operation of
scratching.</p>
      <p>What more need be said! No circumlocution of words will add to
the ending of a tale, but perhaps serve only to conceal the point. The
author is careful of his reputation. He restores the hero to his
original position, in full possession of his senses.</p>

      <p><i>Nux Vomica.</i> Can you give me a description of the
sellebrated needall gun?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Your spelling is so eccentric that we guess you to
be connected with the <i>Tribune</i>. As for the "needall" gun, we
should define it as a gun without lock, stock, barrel, flint,
percussion-cap, powder, ball, or anything else.</p>
      <p><i>O.D.V.</i> Yes: a man may die of <i>delirium tremens</i>
produced by drinking too much French wine. If the wine should happen to
be Ch&acirc;teau Margot, the verdict of a Coroner's Jury would probably
be&#8212;"died of a margot on the brain."</p>
      <p><i>Fumigator.</i> What is the proper spelling of the smoking
mixture known as "Killikinnick"?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Some authorities derive it from a story about an
old Canadian having smoked himself to death with it, and spell it "Kill
a Kannuck." Others spell it "Kill a Cynic," and believe that DIOGENES,
the founder of the Cynical School of philosophy, died of a surfeit of
the article.</p>
      <p><i>Otis Bunker.</i> Was there not, in old times, a tax on
fires in England, and did it not lead to an insurrection?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> No tax on fires that we ever heard of. You are
thinking, probably, of the Curfew Tolls mentioned by GRAY.</p>
      <p><i>Simon Succotash.</i> The expression to "wind a horn" is
frequently used. Do people wind one as they would a watch; and, if so,
what sort of key do they use?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Try the key of A Flat: <i>you</i> are sure to
have it.</p>
      <p><i>Pump-Handle.</i> Is it possible for a person to sleep
during an earthquake?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Yes: we are acquainted with persons who can sleep
soundly upon any kind of shake-down.</p>
      <p><i>Philander.</i> What is the best way of testing a horse's
temper?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> If you have a suspicion that the horse is quick to
take a fence, just dash him at one and try.</p>
      <p><i>Gorman Dyzer.</i> We think it quite proper, as you suppose,
to eat sausages with turkey on Thanksgiving Day. We decline to answer
your other question, as to whether it is right to eat turkey with
sausages on Thanksgiving Day. It is irrelevant.</p>
      <p><i>Caspar Van Keek.</i> Why is the height of a horse given in
hands instead of feet?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Because it is considered handier, of course.</p>
      <p><i>John of Boston.</i> I have been blackballed at a club. What
am I to do?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Let things alone. Clubs are not always Trumps.</p>
      <p><i>Margaret Shortcake.</i>&#8212;I have a great dread of being
buried alive. Will holding a looking-glass to the face of a person
supposed to be dead determine whether breathing has ceased or not?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> The test is used by physicians. There is an
instance on record of a looking-glass being thus applied to a young
girl who had been unconscious for hours. She opened her eyes to look at
herself in it, which proved that she was wide awake.</p>
      <p><i>Widow McRue.</i>&#8212;How soon after my husband's death would it
be proper for me to give up my weeds?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> If your husband allowed you to smoke during his
life-time, we do not see why you should give up the practice after his
death. Although we do not approve of women smoking, yet a fragrant weed
between pearly teeth, with an azure cloud curling heavenward from it,
has a certain fascination, and so our advice is, "Dry up (your tears),
and light a fresh Havana."</p>
      <p><i>Speculator.</i>&#8212;What is the best way to double a $20 bill?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> With a paper-folder.</p>
      <p><i>Frost-on-the-Pane.</i>&#8212;From languid circulation, or some
other cause, I frequently go to bed with cold feet. How can I remedy
this?<br>
      <i>Answer.</i> Don't go to bed. Sleep in a chair.</p>

      <p><b>POLITICS AS A FINE ART.</b></p>
      <p>First Class in Politics, stand up.</p>
      <p>First boy&#8212;Define politics as an art.</p>
      <p>Politics are the art of eating, drinking, sleeping, and
wearing good clothes at the public expense.</p>
      <p>Next&#8212;Is taking presents of houses, horses, &amp;c., included
in this art?</p>
      <p>No sir, that's a natural gift.</p>
      <p>Who invented politics?</p>
      <p>It has been stated by Mr. SUMNER that politics were well known
to the early Greeks and Romans; but they were first reduced to an art
by T. WEED.</p>
      <p>What are the elements of success in politics?</p>
      <p>Cheek and stamps.</p>
      <p>At what place is this art most cultivated?</p>
      <p>At Washington.</p>
      <p>How many classes of politicians are there?</p>
      <p>Three: big strikes, little strikes, and repeaters.</p>
      <p>Define them.</p>
      <p>Big strikes are those who, when they make a haul, mean
business. Little strikes are those who look after the pence, while the
big strikes are looking after the pounds. Both these classes have
steady occupation. Repeaters are little strikes who are employed only
at election time.</p>
      <p>Where are they found?</p>
      <p>In both the Republican and Democratic schools.</p>
      <p>JOHN SMITH, go to the board and do this example: If the House
of Representatives has a Republican majority of thirty, and it remains
in session until 8 P.M. on the 4th of July, at what time will a
Democrat, whose seat is contested by a Republican, obtain that seat?</p>
      <p>THOMAS BROWN, you can try the same example with the Assembly
at Albany, only taking the majority as Democratic, and the man whose
seat is contested as Republican.</p>
      <p>Next boy&#8212;Who are the most successful artists among politicians?</p>
      <p>Carpet-baggers.</p>
      <p>What is the art now called in the South?</p>
      <p>Black art.</p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p>Because the leading artists there are of an off color.</p>
      <p>JOHN SMITH, have you finished your example?</p>
      <p>Yes, sir.</p>
      <p>When will that Democrat be admitted, if the session ends at 8
P.M. on the 4th of July?</p>
      <p>At 5 minutes after 8 on that day.</p>
      <p>THOMAS BROWN, what is your answer? When will that Republican
be admitted?</p>
      <p>At 5 minutes after 8 P.M. on the 4th of July.</p>
      <p>Both correct. That proves that politics have been reduced to a
fine art. The class is dismissed.</p>

      <p><b>BOSTON FIRST.</b></p>
      <p>Even in the matter of earthquakes the proverbial superiority
of Boston to all other places, as a centre, has just been proved. A
writer in the <i>Evening Post</i>, discussing the comparative
phenomena of the late earthquake at various points, says:&#8212;</p>
      <p>"Allowing seven and a half minutes for difference of local
time, the shock was two minutes earlier at Boston than at New Haven.
This implies that Boston was nearer to the centre of disturbance than
New Haven."</p>
      <p>Further developments will doubtless show that Boston was ahead
not of New Haven only, in the enjoyment of the refreshing young
cataclasm referred to, but was the absolute "Hub" from which it
radiated, and therefore ahead of all the rest of creation in regard of
earthquakes as everything else. Property has already gone up to a
tremendous figure at Boston, owing to the multifarious fascinations of
the place; but the greatest chance folks there ever had to "pile it on"
is the admission of the earthquake as a "Boston notion."</p>

      <p>&#8212;While he was about it, why didn't the Rev. WHITCOMB advertise
the other jobs for which orders might be left at the same shop? Why
didn't he say: "Funerals attended with neatness and despatch?" or,
"Gentlemen about to leave the world, will be waited upon at their own
bed-sides without additional charge?" or, "Cases of conscience
adjudicated upon the most reasonable terms?" or, "A fine assortment of
moral advice just received, and for sale in lots to suit purchasers?"
Let the Rev. WHITCOMB take our hint, enlarge the field of his
advertising, and make lots of the Mammon of Unrighteousness.</p>

      <p><b>CHEERFUL PHILOSOPHY.</b></p>
      <p>We remember a writer who merited more notice than he actually
received, for his well-considered thoughts on the behavior of
Mourners,&#8212;whose conduct, as a general thing, is certainly open to
criticism.</p>
      <p>It is all well enough&#8212;"due to decency," in fact&#8212;to wear
"mourning," and now and then look grave; but "this idea of closing your
house," observed our philosopher, "and silencing your piano, and
abstaining from your customary amusements and habits <i>for months</i>
[only think of it!], because some one has departed from misery to
happiness, is not alone supremely ridiculous [though <i>that</i> is
bad enough], but it is sublimely preposterous and [what is yet more]
disgraceful to the last degree of shame."</p>
      <p>Precisely; just what we have always said, whether we believed
it or not. It is what any feeling man <i>would</i> say.</p>
      <p>The fact is, people sacrifice too much to their friends.
Especially after the friends are dead. "The cream of the joke is," as
our lively essayist remarks, "that the dead do not dream of your
sufferings on their account."</p>
      <p>And suppose they did: what <i>is</i> a friend, any way? Why,
something you would do well to rid yourself of as soon as possible.
There is scarcely anything mean, sordid, contemptible, and disgusting,
that an average friend won't do without winking.</p>
      <p>It would certainly contribute greatly to the cheerfulness of
one about to leave this "mortial wale," to feel morally certain that
nobody cared a rap about him, or was going to make any fuss just for a
trifle like that.</p>
      <p>We must say, however, we would prefer to see our mourning
friends go the whole figure, and not visit the opera in weeds. Be
jolly, but also <i>look</i> jolly.</p>
      <p>The trouble seems to be, that people <i>will</i> be
sentimental; they must do a certain amount of tribulation, "whether or
no." We would not even counsel the wearing of black diamonds. We would
refrain from jet, bog, and ebony. We would not try to grin through a
disguise of skull and bones. Be gay (and by all means <i>look</i> gay)

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
